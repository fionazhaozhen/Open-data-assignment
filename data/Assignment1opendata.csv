The objective of the LMP - Increment 2 is to enhance LMP by implementing and fully integrating the documented and approved Expanded Industrial Base (EIB) requirements. The EIB requirements include Shop Floor Automation (SFA), Item Unique Identification (IUID), Enterprise Equipment Master (EEM), Automated Identification Technology (AIT), and Plant Equipment Maintenance (PM). Over the past five years, the EIB requirements have emerged from the DoD, the Army and the AMC industrial base. Under close examination of the total requirements set and in line with the current LMP solution, it became clear that EIB requirements were very interrelated and needed to be designed and tested together in a comprehensive solution based on the SAP capabilities. Examination of the complexity involved in implementing these requirements independently is neither logical nor supportable within current resource constraints. Accordingly, the Army determined the need to address these requirements by expanding the LMP solution. The solution for these requirements will be designed, built, and tested together and implemented in cohesive packages to the LMP user community that will meet the critical needs of the various stakeholders, enabling the Department to achieve a clean audit while providing interoperable tools for total asset visibility across the Defense Enterprise.  Ultimately, LMP - Increment 2 will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the currently deployed solution by providing the critical (e.g. must have) SFA requirements integrated with IUID, EEM, AIT, and PM. The enhancements provided by EIB will provide access to real-time supply chain information at all levels of the enterprise down through the shop floor, and will result in manufacturing (MAN) and remanufacturing (REMAN) capabilities that will improve visibility of work-in-process (WIP), quality management, capacity planning, and traceability/genealogy capability; and implementation of electronic work instructions.

The MDD also supported the development of acquisition planning documentation with a target to enter the formal acquisition process.    Phase I of the AoA focused on preliminary assessment of nine (9) alternatives; five (5) of the alternatives were considered potentially viable and carried into the AoA Phase II for more detailed analysis. During the second quarter of FY11, TMA was directed to pause the AoA to support the joint program analysis efforts undertaken by the DoD and VA.  On March 17, 2011, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the VA agreed to jointly pursue a common EHR acquisition.  The Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) (a follow on to originally proposed Electronic Health Record Way Ahead) is designed to provide a comprehensive, longitudinal, electronic health record that is available anytime and anywhere for the lifetime of the patient.

It has automatic and on-demand position and status reporting for situation awareness.The US Army''s Force Battlefield Command for Brigade and Below (FBCB2) employs EPLRS as the data communication system backbone for the Tactical Internet (TI). SADL, a variant of EPLRS for aircraft, takes advantage of the EPLRS networking and communications services to provide the pilot with situation awareness and combat ID for the TI.The SADL radio is integrated with the aircraft avionics and displays, providing the pilot with real-time visual tactical data exchange with his wingmen, supporting a variety of co-operative engagement tactics. Fighter positions, radar targets, fuel/weapons stores and ground target positions are shared. The fighter-to-fighter SADL network operation is autonomous and does not rely on the ground-based TI, but can join it, when present, to acquire the ground friendly TI position data. The pilot controls the point around which he can see the closest five TI ground positions, providing for fratricide avoidance in CAS missions.

MA plans are paid approximately $13 billion per month for the more than 11 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans.  Improvements in the accuracy of these payments will have a significant impact on the program. The current risk adjustment model is estimated using Fee-For-Service (FFS) cost and diagnoses data. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has shown that patterns in FFS and MA diagnostic data differ in important ways and lead to overpayments to MA plans. Adding health care encounter data to the existing risk adjustment system will improve the accuracy of the risk adjustment model used to pay MA plans by reflecting the appropriate patterns of utilization and costs within the MA program. While establishing a risk adjustment model more appropriate for MA plans is the paramount reason for collecting MA encounter data, there are other important uses of the data that will improve other key functions undertaken by CMS, including: calculation of Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, quality review and improvement activities, and Medicare coverage purposes. Thus, there is a need to properly collect, edits, and store the MA health care data necessary to describe and price a health care encounter; this is in addition to the currently collected, edited and stored diagnosis data.  There is also a need to develop the capability to price the MA health care encounter data to be able to estimate the cost of a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in an MA plan. The EDS project will assist CMS in achieving its agency-wide goal of reaching accurate and predictable payments.  Specifically, those paid through the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MARx). The three main objectives to obtain with the implementation of the EDS project are: Collection and pricing of more than 330 million claims annually supporting 11 million beneficiaries enrolled in the MA program, Obtain reports that reflect true MA beneficiary utilization by 2013, and Providing appropriate data leading to more accurate Risk Adjustment model development by 2015.",2009-01-01T00:00:00Z,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2191,,,,45.43,45.43,46.108,23/07/2012,9:41:12,

In 2006, Executive Order 13410 required healthcare programs administered or sponsored by the Federal government to promote quality and efficient delivery through the use of health information technology. HHS was tasked with developing a program to assist agencies to meet EO 13410 and monitor their progress. Subsequently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established.   The FHA is a partnership among Federal Agencies and the OMB, and managed by ONC with HHS, acting as the Managing Partner, along with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acting as Lead Partners, provides funding for the program. These agencies collaborate to advance health information interoperability between Federal Agencies, and between agencies and the tribal, state, local and private sectors.  Through the FHA program, Federal Agencies have joined together to rapidly and efficiently implement government-wide solutions for interoperable and secure health information exchange that address agency business priorities, while protecting citizen privacy.

The FWM component will provide all of the functionality for completing Field work. This is work where an FDA person does actual work dealing directly with a regulated product. FWM 3 includes work on inspections, investigations, field exams, sample collections, portions of sample analysis, third party certification and auditing (TPCA), and compliance follow up. FWM 3 will focus on completing inspections, building investigations, field exams, and sample collections, gathering requirements for sample analysis, TPCA, and compliance follow up. Field operations is one of the six domains that make up the ORA work flows. FWM is the component that will provide the functionality for this domain. This is a large set of functionality that is being built out over a set of projects. Functionality is built out in an incremental fashion where, for example, one project might focus on requirements and design and another project would focus on development and test. This is the case for inspections, which was mostly built in FWM 2 but will now be finished in FWM 3. Functionality in this component is being built for two separate user platforms. It will be available on the standard FDA laptops. It will also be available on Remote Access Devices (RADs). RADs are handheld devices. A pilot will be conducted using Apple and Android products to prove out the expected ROI and determine a final RAD platform. This is the first time a RAD will be directly integrated with the FDA network, so a number of issues need to be resolved. In addition, functionality on laptops and RADs will be available in two modes: online and offline.

However, as the HHS the Office of is in early planning stages seeking to implement the Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS) as a Department-wide budget formulation tool, this effort will focus on the budget planning through budget execution functions with an interface to DEBS and integration with UFMS.  Improvement in this area directly affects audit material weaknesses related to budgetary analysis,[1] such as reducing manual entries and facilitating compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA).  This also addresses a common sentiment among the user groups that UFMS is an accounting system rather than a financial management system.The Hyperion Performance-Based Budgeting Solution provides an enterprise-level solution for budget formulation, execution, and distribution, which eliminates the need for multiple spreadsheets, separate feeder applications, and numerous individual processes.  This will allow users to spend less time reconciling data and more time analyzing and planning, provides for more accurate reports to OMB, the ability to monitor and measure agency performance against agency goals, provides security and audit trails, and offers a variety of statements and reports.  This solution seeks to replace cuff systems that are currently used by budget staff across HHS agencies to meet the functionality gap that exists today.

For EM, this will focus on migrating functionality from the legacy systems Operational and Administrate System for Import Support (OASIS) and Entry Review to support 801(a) screening. For ITACS, this will focus on account management (via Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS)) and additional functionality enabled by logins. For PREDICT, this will focus on building functionality to better manage rules. For PNM and CSI, this will focus on requirements. EM will provide functionality for screening, in conjunction with PREDICT, for the majority of the 20,000,000+ products imported via the 801(a) process annually. This will give import screeners and import compliance officers a unified interface for dealing with all of their work flows, including tracking Field Work (accomplished in Field Work Manager (FWM)). PREDICT is an expert system built around a rules engine that produces a risk-based score of imported products. Products with a low score are automatically sent forward by PREDICT. Products with a higher score require an import screener to review the product by using EM. ITACS is used to interface with import filers and industry to provide a conduit for supporting documentation. This will reduce the current use of phone calls and emails, provide FDA with a more reliable information source and record, and give industry a more efficient way of communicating. Use of this component by industry is voluntary, so it must provide an incentive for external partners. PNM will provide the interface for work flows associated with 801(m) import screening, Prior Notice, which is focused on Food Security and Food Safety.

This includes an expansion of the licenses for the BPMS (Business Process Management Suite) (including Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)), Oracle Identity Management (IDM) Suite, WebCenter, Oracle Policy Automation (OPA), and Real User Experience Insight (RUEI). The license expansion for the BPMS includes enough licenses for all FDA users. A number of FDA Centers have expressed interest in using this platform for their systems. MARCS has a primary focus on integration across the organization and as the BPMS would help further this goal, these licenses have been expanded to enable organization wide integration. IDM will give MARCS a comprehensive COTS solution to provide the specialized functionality and fine grained security control envisioned. This will require some custom code to realize envisioned functionality. The custom code will be developed under Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 2 - Supplemental. IDM may also be leveraged as an FDA wide solution in the future. The implementation of IDM will be used by every component within MARCS. This has been vetted with the FDA CIO and HHS CIO and conforms to HHS standard security. WebCenter provides robust user interface and portal capabilities. This COTS will be used to implement User Workspace Enhancement Services (UWES), which is part of the Support Services project. UWES will provide a standardized user experience customized based on user role and single user preferences. OPA is a rules engine that will have a number of applications in MARCS ranging from inspection preparation, intelligent questionnaires, and import screening support. RUEI is a tool that can be used from a centralized location to determine the experience that an end user at a remote site is having. ORA is a geographically dispersed organization. In this sense, the user community for MARCS is different from Center user communities since the vast majority of users are not in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. This tool will give ORA and OIM a new ability to understand what is actually happening at user sites and will enable a systematic approach towards improving performance and reliability in the Field.

This investment will enable the development of standards in health information exchange that follow the consumer, be available for critical clinical decision making, and support appropriate use of healthcare information beyond direct patient care so as to improve health outcomes. The investment seeks to achieve these goals by coordinating stakeholders in developing interoperable standards and by engaging industry and federal agencies in developing prototypes and trials. Executive Order 13410 requires Federal Agencies to adopt health IT standards that have been recognized by the HHS Secretary when developing or enhancing health information systems.     Initially established as a program under ONC in 2004, the goals of the program, then called NHIN Exchange were to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare by establishing a mechanism for nationwide health information exchange. The NwHIN Exchange went through a prototyping and trial implementations phase where an architecture and set of Service Oriented Architecture based specifications were developed to provide a common, secure and trusted network to enable the exchange of health information among private networks and Federal health networks. The effort effectively integrated specifications, implementation guidelines, compliance, interoperability verification, and network operations with a strong trust fabric to allow for interoperable health information exchange.      The NwHIN program has evolved to become much more flexible, to include specifications from not only the NHIN Exchange program, but also use specifications developed from the ONC led Direct project. The NwHIN program is envisaged to include a portfolio of specifications from Exchange, Direct and Blue Button.

It will be available on the standard FDA laptops. It will also be available on Remote Access Devices (RADs). RADs are handheld devices. This includes an investigation into potential RAD platforms and a recommendation for this. This is the first time a RAD will be directly integrated with the FDA network, so a number of issues need to be resolved. In addition, functionality on laptops and RADs will be available in two modes: online and offline. An offline mode is needed as Field work is often done in remote locations with little or no connectivity. The technology that is being used to implement this is Sybase SQL Anywhere and Afaria.

NSD is used to route samples collected by the ORA Field to an appropriate and available laboratory.  This will be an important integration point between MARCS and the Automated Laboratory Management (ALM) Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The WAAM component will be used to plan, assign, and track all work in MARCS. The functionality provided by WAAM will be used by all of the ORA work flows in MARCS. WAAM will provide functionality that will be used by all of the application components in MARCS. WAAM functionality is being built out over a set of projects, often in conjunction with work on FWM. Functionality is built out in an incremental fashion where, for example, one project might focus on requirements and design and another project would focus on development and test.",2012-03-30T00:00:00Z,2013-03-29T00:00:00Z,364,,,,1.155,1.155,1.155,23/02/2012,12:00:18,

This includes additional Center integration, gray area resolution, additional support for Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB) integration, and improved integration with  Mission Accomplishments and Regulatory Compliance Services (MARCS) Predictive Risk-based Evaluation and Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT) for validating firm information.

This will focusing on improving and automating more of this information transfer. Gray area resolution is used to resolve uncertainties regarding firm information when the survivorship rules used in FMLS do not produce a clear resolution. Survivorship rules are implemented via the COTS Dataflux and are an automated way to correct firm data, merge, unmerge, and delete Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEI). Manual gray area resolution is performed to tweak survivorship rules and manually resolve information discrepancies. DnB integration will be expanded, including a review of the current firm inventory in ORA and matching these against DnB information to produce a confidence level from 1 to 10 (10 is highest confidence) to support estimating the risk associated with a firm based on the quality of firm information. This will be used to support risk based decisions such as used for import screening. The method used to validate firm information from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that is then used by PREDICT in import screening will be modified to improve this, reduce latency, reduce uncertainty, and reduce reprocessing.

This provides access to historical data from a number of systems, such as MARCS. The DW further contains a reporting database that retains the schema from the Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database from which information was originated. The DW has information in it that has been transformed into a star schema so that it is a Decision Support System (DSS). In addition, for some user communities, it is much more effective for them to only have to deal with a subset of all of the data in the DW. For such user communities, ORADSS has a number of Data Marts (DM) that certain designated users can use for querying. These are also used to support universes for reporting. ORADSS uses a COTS, Business Objects (BO), as a reporting tool. BO utilizes universes as a meta-data layer that allows for an abstraction of the underlying schema, table names, row names, and data types so that non technical users can access this data more easily. The universe structures may then be used to build reports. End users typically interact with the reports, but there are a number of end users who need to delve more deeply into the data than is allowed by a report. These users may access the DW, DMs, or universes directly depending on their particular needs.

This would consolidate all levels of appeal in one system, and allow an electronic case file to be used throughout the life of the appeal with a clear audit trail of all actions taken. Since May and September 2005, CMS and OMHA have, respectively, established functionality for level 2 and level 3 appeals tracking in MAS and continually enhance that functionality. However, without the level 1 appeals information in the system, there are still many issues in obtaining and transmitting the correct appeals information throughout the appeals process. The primary purpose of the MAS is to collect and maintain the information necessary to process Medicare claim appeals.  The MAS currently tracks procedural and medical appeals data including, but not limited to, appeal status, appeal timeliness, appeal disposition, claims information, and services at issue.  All of the information captured in the MAS on the workflow processing side (in Siebel) is available in a customized reporting suite (in Cognos) and can be extracted and analyzed.  Given the MAS' capabilities for cross-level case tracking, interfacing with the shared systems, and electronic imaging, we believe that expanding use of the MAS to encompass first level appeals has the potential to create significant efficiencies in the claim appeals process.

FMLS does the back end heavy lifting work for managing firm information. This includes receiving firm information from registration and listing from the FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS). FURLS is being partially replaced by eLIST. FMLS will integrate with eLIST (no acronym). The firm data is built around Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEIs). These define a location and a product or a set of products. A large company may have multiple FEIs if it has multiple physical locations and/or produces different products that are regulated by FDA. This information is always changing as firms and market conditions change.  In addition, foreign firms that do not use a Latin alphabet present a particular problem as words can be transliterated into English in different ways. If this is left unchecked, it causes a proliferation of FEIs that are not all that useful in identifying what firm is what. To address this, FMLS employs Dataflux, a COTS, in implementing survivorship rules that are used to clean up this firm data and consolidate and remove FEIs.

A concept engineering analysis of proposed Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) and Tower and Surface traffic management capabilities will be performed to determine which concepts are most beneficial to safely increase capacity, reduce traffic delays, lower costs, and reduce impact on the surrounding environment. The expected outcome of these efforts will result in enhanced capabilities that provide more efficient, safer movement and control of air traffic in the terminal domain. This will also ensure smoother transition into and out of the terminal airspace in support of consolidation of airspace and provide guidance for implementing projects as part of the NextGen Concept of Operations. In previous years, the enabling technologies/information was assessed and methods developed for gathering data, integrating information (i.e., flight data object, clearance (taxi/takeoff) information, surveillance information, user (aircraft/pilot/ airport operators)) and receipt/acceptance of that data. Based on these capabilities, a series of decision support tools were identified.

Metered times at key merge points will be used by air traffic managers. For this type of operation, an aircraft's Meter Point Time (MPT) is assigned to determine when it enters into the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) airspace so it can be efficiently routed to the assigned runway. Metering will take into account runway load balancing and will serve to reduce (not eliminate) the need for delay absorption needed for aircraft inside the TRACON airspace. As the FAA transitions to NextGen, aircraft will increasingly be assigned to RNP/RNAV routes and have modern avionics that include Flight Management Systems (FMS) capable of executing Required Time of Arrival (RTA) instructions. The RTA capability provides a time-based control mechanism that supports the trajectory-based operations concept. RTAs will be used for the management of arrival traffic to an airport. The use of RTAs will take advantage of existing capabilities expected to become more widespread throughout the fleet. The FMS in the aircraft computes the most efficient change to the original trajectory to meet the RTA. In addition, the FMS can independently self deliver to the RTA, thus reducing significantly the coordination needed between the user and ATC. Since the FMS actively and directly controls the aircraft to meet the RTA, very accurate arrival is possible with minimal human intervention.",2010-01-10T00:00:00Z,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,993,,,,8.072247,7.747247,7.755171,24/02/2012,13:59:36,

RWI weather observation improvements will manage the evolution of the existing capability to one that possesses the optimal quantity and quality of ground, air, and space-based sensors. Initial activities include assessing the current sensor network capabilities and identifying gaps. Technical studies will then be conducted to identify economical methods to consolidate existing legacy capabilities, provide improved capability, and make sensor outputs more universally available. When fielded, this will result in a homogenous network of sensing equipment that requires fewer resources to maintain and manage and is readily accessible to all NextGen users. Weather Observation Improvements will optimize quality and accuracy, while Weather Forecast Improvements will enhance coverage, accuracy, real-time forecasting techniques, and translation techniques for weather integration support to users and Decision Support Tools (DSTs).",2010-01-10T00:00:00Z,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,993,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,993,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,10.59037,10.585474,7.701822,23/08/2012,11:37:27,

Conflict resolution advisories will first be implemented using voice and data in a mixed equipage environment, and ultimately will be transmitted solely via data in certain airspace. The implications for changing controller roles and responsibilities will be explored and the requirements for automation, decision support systems and data communications will be identified. High performance aircraft will directly connect via air-ground data communications to the flight management system, facilitating electronic data communications between the Air Traffic Control (ATC) automation and the flight deck automation. As a first step and in mixed performance airspace, the controller will still be responsible for aircraft separation by responding to problems predicted by the ATC automation. Instead of monitoring the sector airspace display to predict potential problems and mentally calculating problem resolutions, the automation will not only predict the problems but determine the best solution. The controller will transmit the solution via voice initially, and then via data link. This level of automation support helps manage controller workload as a means of safely dealing with the predicted increases in traffic volume. This activity will prototype earlier and easier resolutions capabilities (such as pre-probed altitude and speed amendments) that can be transferred verbally by controllers and evaluate the impact these have on the Computer Human Interface (CHI) design and system performance and conduct research into more complex issues for future implementation such as vector advisories as well as the role of the human versus automation in voice clearance, mixed voice and data communications environments, and data communications only.",2010-01-10T00:00:00Z,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,993,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,993,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,3.092484,3.092484,3.005308,27/04/2012,14:16:19,

It will identify cognitive support and display change requirements for early transition to a high altitude specialty and will develop and validate automation changes needed to implement a new high altitude operating concept that will create a more flexible high altitude airspace concept by increasing staffing flexibility, reducing training time, and enabling traffic peaks to be handled by fewer controllers. Initial operational concept development and validation efforts have concluded that in high altitude airspace, the local knowledge information needed is considerably less than in lower altitude airspace and that different operating strategies can be used to more dynamically adjust staffing and airspace to meet demand and reduce operating costs. By providing local knowledge through information accessible through the controller display and other tools, there will be increased flexibility in the assignment of airspace to controllers, increasing overall productivity and flexibility to deal with weather and congestion events. This activity will work to define and develop the information display and decision support tool changes to provide this local knowledge and conduct human-in-the-loop simulations with controllers to assess the effectiveness of the information content and automation and display changes to enable rapid training (in terms of hours) of controllers to safely and efficiently control the airspace.",2010-01-10T00:00:00Z,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,993,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,993,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,2.505128,2.505128,2.550497,27/04/2012,14:16:19,

It is the only NAS-deployed decision support tool currently available for implementation of time-based metering. TMA has been field-tested over the past 10 years and is already installed in the twenty Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) and adapted for most of the major airports served by those ARTCCs. The Time Based Flow Management Program is divided into three segments. Segment I, Initial TMA platform of capabilities, was completed in April 2009. Segment II, Current TBFM program, is a continuation of TMA that will fulfill operational user needs and NextGen goals. The TBFM program will incorporate NextGen concepts such as extended metering, weather integration, and metering with Area Navigation (RNAV)/Required Navigation Performance (RNP), while expanding the TMA core capabilities to additional locations in the NAS.

Weather conditions create low visibility conditions that require Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) to go into effect. Even for those aircraft with suitably trained crew and equipage, conditions may worsen, causing flight diversion, flight cancellation, or flight delays, each of which can result in a cascading ripple effect that can spread throughout the National Airspace System (NAS), even to areas where weather is not an issue. There are periods of low visibility when the aircraft cannot takeoff or land at their desired airport resulting in the following conditions: decreased numbers of arrivals/departures at high density airports; increased flight delays, cancellations, and/or diversions under IFR low visibility conditions; decreased capacity for airlines to schedule flights in marginal weather conditions (since both the primary and alternate routes must be approved within the flight plan); and decreased flexibility/potential congestion in the terminal environment. These problems can limit or prevent access to airports in IFR conditions, resulting in congestion and delay in the NAS. Even under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), access to airports and utilization of airspace can be made more flexible, particularly in the terminal environment. Therefore, lowering required RVR minima will improve capacity during low visibility operations by allowing runways that would otherwise be unusable to continue to support airport operations.",2011-01-10T00:00:00Z,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,628,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,628,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,1.1,1.1,1.1,24/02/2012,13:59:36,

On August 27, 2004, the President issued a Homeland Security Presidential Directive calling for a mandatory, government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the federal government to its employees and federal contractors. The implementation of this Standard will ensure the identification for government employees and contractors is reliable and secure. The establishment of the PIV credential as part of a broader well managed enterprise solution enables common service capabilities in secure and reliable transactions. Further, it expedites SBAs ability to enable IT solutions that directly address line of business needs for disaster response, automated small business services such as electronic (and paperless) workflow services, and reduction in other existing investments for help desk operations and password management. E-Authentication falls within the scope of Identity and Access Management. This initiative expands e-Government by providing users access to online services that require authentication, using a solution that is secure as well as convenient and easy for customers, resulting in an improvement in the taxpayer experience. Through minimizing the burden on America's small businesses, the general public, and government partners, this initiative eliminates the need for separate processes for verification of identity and validation of electronic signatures. The IAM initiative provides a robust, highly secure, easy to manage centralized solution that automates the provisioning and deprovisioning of user identities mapped and managed to individual/entities, and manages each aspect of the identity lifecycle. By automating services, and doing so in accordance with well defined rules and role determination, SBA simplifies the independent management frameworks currently instituted individually by each application. As part of implementing security solutions at the individual application level, SBA addresses security risks on an individual basis, does not take advantage of economies of scale, and institutes varying levels of security, cost, and schedule risk across each program.
